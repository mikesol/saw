Yeh, it's sad, believe me, Missy\\
When you're born to be a sissy\\
Without the vim and verve\\
\hfill\\
But I could change my habits\\
Never more be scared of rabbits\\
If I only had the nerve\\
\hfill\\
I'm afraid there's no denying\\
I'm just an awful dandy-lion\\
A fate I don't deserve\\
\hfill\\
But I could show my prowess\\
Be a lion, not a mouse\\
If I only had the nerve\\
\hfill\\
Oh I'd be in my stride\\
A king down to the core\\
Oh I roar the way I never roared before\\
And then I'd rrwuff\\
And roar some more\\
\hfill\\
I would show the dinosaurus\\
Who's king around the forus\\
A king they's better serve\\
\hfill\\
And with my regal beezer\\
I could be another ceaser\\
If I only had the nerve\\
\hfill\\
I'd be brave as a blizzard\\
I'd be gentle as a lizard\\
I'd be clever as a gizzard\\
If the Wizard is a Wizard who will serve?\\
\hfill\\
Then I'm sure to get a brain\\
A heart, a home, the nerve\\
\hfill\\
We're off to see the wizard the wonderful wizard of Oz\\
We hear that he is a whiz of a wiz\\
If ever a wiz was there\\
If ever, oh ever a wiz there was\\
The Wizard of Oz is one because, because, because, because, because, because\\
Of the wonderful things he does\\
We're off to see the wizard the wonderful wizard of Oz\\
